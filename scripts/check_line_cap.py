"""No tracked file is longer than a reviewer can read (Q-R81).

Every tracked file is counted, whoever or whatever wrote it. A generated file is
read as often as a written one: in a diff, by the reader of a vendored copy, and by
the generator of the next thing downstream. One that outgrows a reader has to be
split where it is generated.

Two kinds of file are not counted, and the list is written here and nowhere else:
the lockfiles a package manager writes and nobody reads line by line, and the
images and fonts that are binary or, in an SVG's case, drawn rather than read.

A file a repository's `scripts/generated.py` registers with `sources` is read
through those sources, so it is held to the cap through them: it passes where every
source is tracked and within the cap, and is refused naming a source that is not.
The registry is read as data, never run.

Usage, from the root of the repository being checked::

    check_line_cap.py --root .

Exit 0 = every counted file is within the cap, 1 = at least one is over it, or the
tree could not be listed.
